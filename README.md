# Indexer SubQuery Tutorial - Example Project for Asset Chain Testnet

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network) is a fast, flexible, and reliable open-source data indexer that provides you with custom APIs for your web3 project across all of our supported networks. To learn about how to get started with SubQuery, [visit our docs](https://academy.subquery.network).

**This SubQuery project indexes all TokenCreated events for the Multitokenlauncher (`0x6fCc46E73E5B96479F6fA731893534b6Ec6bf5E1`) on Asset Chain Testnet**

## Start

First, install SubQuery CLI globally on your terminal by using NPM `npm install -g @subql/cli`

You can either clone this GitHub repo, or use the `subql` CLI to bootstrap a clean project in the network of your choosing by running `subql init` and following the prompts.

Don't forget to install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`!

## Editing your SubQuery project

Although this is a working example SubQuery project, you can edit the SubQuery project by changing the following files:

- The project manifest in `project.yaml` defines the key project configuration and mapping handler filters
- The GraphQL Schema (`schema.graphql`) defines the shape of the resulting data that you are using SubQuery to index
- The Mapping functions in `src/mappings/` directory are typescript functions that handle transformation logic

SubQuery supports various layer-1 blockchain networks and provides [dedicated quick start guides](https://academy.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart.html) as well as [detailed technical documentation](https://academy.subquery.network/build/introduction.html) for each of them.

## Run your project

_If you get stuck, find out how to get help below._

The simplest way to run your project is by running `yarn dev` or `npm run-script dev`. This does all of the following:

1.  `yarn codegen` - Generates types from the GraphQL schema definition and contract ABIs and saves them in the `/src/types` directory. This must be done after each change to the `schema.graphql` file or the contract ABIs
2.  `yarn build` - Builds and packages the SubQuery project into the `/dist` directory
3.  `docker-compose pull && docker-compose up` - Runs a Docker container with an indexer, PostgeSQL DB, and a query service. This requires [Docker to be installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) and running locally. The configuration for this container is set from your `docker-compose.yml`

You can observe the three services start, and once all are running (it may take a few minutes on your first start), please open your browser and head to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) - you should see a GraphQL playground showing with the schemas ready to query. [Read the docs for more information](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/run.html) or [explore the possible service configuration for running SubQuery](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/references.html).

## Query your project

For this project, you can try to query with the following GraphQL code to get a taste of how it works.


```graphql
query GetAllTokensCreated {
  tokenCreateds{
    edges {
      node {
        id
        tokenAddress
        owner
        name
        symbol
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql
query GetSingleTokenCreated {
  tokenCreated(id: "0xbb5d708468aefcbca97711c99d7c7db270c7c521059367c64703b7edf785472c") {
    id
    tokenAddress
    owner
    name
    symbol
  }
}
```
